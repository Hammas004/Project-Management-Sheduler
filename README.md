# Project-Management-Sheduler
A Python-based Project Management Scheduler that implements First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm to manage team tasks. This application allows adding team members, creating tasks with time estimates, assigning tasks, and visualizing the project schedule with waiting/turnaround time metrics.

**Key Features**
**Member Management:** Add and manage team members
**Task Management:** Create, update, and track project tasks
**FCFS Scheduling:** Implements First-Come-First-Served algorithm
**Time Metrics:** Calculates waiting time and turnaround time
**Visual Schedule:** Displays formatted schedule with averages
**Interactive CLI:** User-friendly command-line interface
**Error Handling:** Validates inputs and handles edge cases

**Algorithm Used**
**First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling:**
**1:** Processes tasks in the order they're added
**2:** Calculates start/end times sequentially
**3:** Computes waiting time and turnaround time
**4:** Non-preemptive (tasks run to completion)
